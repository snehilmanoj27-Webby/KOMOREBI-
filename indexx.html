    <h1>  Hi Queen Bee, Its been a wild 5 months, a part of me didn't see this coming but here we are and there is so much more to come! :P . Everytime I've had the chance to see you smile and laugh the distance disappears in a heartbeat. I miss you like crazy and I wish I could see you all the time and be there with you. I can't wait to be with you again my Komorebi, you make my days better and energy double whenever your messages pop up ! Honestly its like you supercharge me.
